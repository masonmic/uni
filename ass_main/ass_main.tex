\begin{abstract} 

Working for Hewlett Packard (will now be refereed to as HP) For 14 months. During time spent worked with two main service teams. Cinder and bock. Cinder, the openstack and opensourced client that provides API for block storage solutions to be consumed by NOVA, the openstack, opensource compute host for cloud solutions, and Bock, the block storage solution implemented within the HP public cloud. Also worked on Helion, private cloud solutions within Cinder service team\\ 
Producing code for bug fixing, features, testing, automation for upstream (openstack(cinder)) downstream(bock)and upstream internal(Helion)while also doing peer code review for mentioned services. 
Working on 24/7 on call support for the public cloud to ensure that services do not experience outage and working closely with technical operations (will now be refereed to as tech ops), to ensure services experience no outage is something I worked towards and successfully integrated myself into.
